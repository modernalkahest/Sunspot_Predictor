# Sunspot_Predictor
* This is a time series forecasting algorithm that looks at the prehistoric data of the number of Sunspots that have appeared on the Sun from the year 1749 to 2010.
* This algorithm can be used for predicting the sun spots for next 10 to 11 years or so witha 98% accuracy.


## Model Used
* SARIMA model: Since the the Sunspots follow a 11 yesr cycle it's better to use a SARIMA model to predict the number sunspots depending on the seasonality shown by the sun
